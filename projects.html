                            <br> Also, it's not updating properly to CPanel.

                        <h1>July 6, 2017</h1>
                        <p>Watched 4 seasons of Silicon Valley yesterday and didn't get as much work done as I would
                            have liked, but today I'm going to try and focus on the website.</p>

                    <div class="entry">
                        <h1>July 5, 2017</h1>
                        <p>I plan to add additional site functionality today and smooth out the aesthetics. Also, I may
                            attempt to connect the site with a SQL database for storing these blog entries to allow for
                            me to post through the site itself. Lastly, the padding is messed up on this blog page and
                            it's pissing me off. Below is a list of the things that I'm adding and it will be updated as
                            I go:
                        <ul class="entry-list">
                            <li>Got rid of the "Risley" text on the front page because it looked odd.</li>
                            <li>Fixed the Navbars so that when you go on one page the current page is highlighted
                                above.
                            </li>
                            <li>Made the image of myself on the About Me page scale to the size of the browser.</li>
                            <li>Fixed the blog's padding issue. Looks a lot nicer now.</li>
                            <li>Added a blog submission section, but since I obviously don't want everyone to have
                                access to posting, I'm going to have to think of a better way to handle it. I wonder if
                                there's a way to give myself some sort of special view that differs from everyone else.
                            </li>
                            <li>Oh sh*t, the padding is messed up again.</li>
                            <li>Okay, fixed it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="entry">
                        <h1>July 3, 2017</h1>
                        <p>This is my first blog entry. I'm still in the process of building the website, and I'm
                            attempting to learn more about design. I'm also in the process of creating my first album.
